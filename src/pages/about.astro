      <p>I'm a freelance full-stack developer based in France.</p>

      <p>My professional journey started in 2014, shortly after I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree in Portugal. I moved to the UK for an internship that turned into a full-time job, building WordPress websites for various clients. After a while, I moved on to Steadfast Collective, where I worked my way up to Technical Lead, building Laravel websites and web applications using Laravel, Vue.js + Inertia, and TailwindCSS as the primary tech stack. In the meanwhile, I moved to France.</p>

      <p>Most recently, I spent just over a year at Atma Energy, working on making solar energy more accessible. At the start of 2026, I made the move to full-time freelance – something I'd been doing on the side since 2020.</p>

      <p>Even though the previously mentioned stack is my favourite, I also love learning new things and spend time exploring new tech and tools.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, I like to spend time with family, be in nature, play sports, game, and many other things.</p>
