At the start of the year, my role at Atma Energy came to an end. It wasn't something I saw coming, but these things rarely are. I spent just over a year there working on making solar energy more accessible, and I'm proud of what we built together.

## A blessing in disguise

The truth is, I already have a running freelance business since 2020. So it made sense to explore that at this time.

Building products for different clients, solving different problems, working with different stacks – it keeps things fresh.

Being laid off gave me the push I needed to commit to it fully.

## What I'm focusing on

I specialize in full-stack web development with Laravel, Vue.js, Inertia, and TailwindCSS. Whether it's building something from scratch, MVPs, or improving performance or adding features on an existing app – that's where I thrive.

I'm particularly interested in working with startups and small teams who need a senior developer they can rely on without the overhead of a full-time hire.

## Let's work together

If you have a project in mind or just want to chat about what I could help with, I'd love to hear from you. You can [schedule a call](https://www.cal.eu/andrebreia) or [send me an email](mailto:contact@andrebreia.dev).

Here's to a new chapter.
