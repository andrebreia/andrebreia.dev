## How I ended up leading a team

TODO: The path from junior to tech lead at Steadfast Collective. What changed when the title changed.

## Code reviews that actually help

TODO: What makes a good code review. Focusing on intent, not style. Asking questions instead of dictating.

## Mentoring developers

TODO: Pairing, giving ownership, letting people fail safely. What worked and what didn't.

## Architecture decisions

TODO: How to make decisions that age well. The value of boring technology. When to introduce complexity.

## What I'd do differently

TODO: Honest reflection — things I got wrong, lessons learned the hard way.
