## The brief

TODO: Set the scene — a client needs to validate a SaaS idea quickly. What the product does, what the constraints are.

## Tech decisions upfront

TODO: Laravel + Inertia + Vue + TailwindCSS. Why this stack for speed. Choosing between Stripe Billing vs Paddle. Auth with Laravel Breeze.

## Week 1: Core features

TODO: Database design, key models, the main user flow. What gets built first and why.

## Week 2: Polish and ship

TODO: Billing integration, transactional emails, basic admin. Deployment with Forge.

## What I deliberately skipped

TODO: Things that don't matter for an MVP — custom design system, advanced permissions, multi-tenancy. Ship now, iterate later.
