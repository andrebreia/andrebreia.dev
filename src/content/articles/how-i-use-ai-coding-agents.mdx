## Why AI agents, not just autocomplete

TODO: Distinction between copilot-style autocomplete vs agentic coding. Why agents are a step change.

## My setup

TODO: Claude Code for interactive pair-programming, Codex for background tasks. When I reach for each one.

## What I delegate

TODO: Scaffolding, refactoring, test writing, boilerplate. Examples from real projects.

## What I don't delegate

TODO: Architecture decisions, database design, security-sensitive code. Why human judgement still matters.

## The productivity impact

TODO: Honest take on speed gains. Where it saves time vs where it costs time (reviewing output, fixing hallucinations).
