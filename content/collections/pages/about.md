            text: 'My professional journey started in 2014, shortly after I graduated with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, in Portugal. I then moved to the UK for an internship, that turned into a full-time job, building WordPress websites for many clients. After a while, I moved on to a PHP developer role at Steadfast Collective, where we build Laravel websites and web applications using Laravel, Vuejs and TailwindCSS as the primary tech stack. In the meanwhile, I moved to France and got a new role at the company as a Tech Lead. Fast forward a few years and I made the move to work as a freelance web developer.'
